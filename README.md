# Ubik Web App v0.1

## About The Project
UBIKAI is a new advertising platform built with Artificial Intelligence (AI) modelled after the book **Ubik** by **Philip K. Dick**. Our goal is to create a system that will be able to generate better ads than any human could ever do. We are currently building out our prototype and have already been working on it for over 6 months now. 
We are planning on creating a full website with a back-end that will allow us to input ad copy, keywords, and several other factors that can influence the ad copy. In addition to creating the system, we are also going to create a proof of concept ad to show off the capabilities of our system. 
Our AI will be able to learn and improve over time as it receives more feedback from users.

You can see a few examples of our models below or alternatively **you can view 1 of 25000 ads generated by Ubik for Ubik at ubikai.org. Refresh to see more.**

#### Golf course

> Imagine a golf course with no forbidden areas, water hazards, out of bounds, or rough ground. Now stop imagining because the perfect golf course is here. The fairways are lush and green. The sand traps are firm and the perfect places to land your ball. The greens are smooth and fast. No need to worry about the weather here, because we have underground tunnels that keep you playing regardless of rain or shine. This is the perfect golf experience.

#### Automatic screwdriver
> Batteries not included! Keeps equipment operating without large and heavy battery packs. The new, high-vibration Ubik vibrating power cell screws directly into light sockets and draws very little power, yet lasts for a long time.
